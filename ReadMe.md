<h1>AppBot - Discordapp Bot for the Official AppValley Discord Server<h1>
<p>AppBot is a DiscordApp bot built using Node.js and the Discordapp API. This bot originially started out in python as a small botfor simple response commands (See https://github.com/RevokedCookie/appbot-py ), and soon became a bot that would run the entire official AppValley Discord server. It has since been archived, and is no longer used as my newest public Discord bot, Retr0n, has started to run the logging, moderation, and everything on that guild. IÂ´ve  set this repository to public, incase any developers starting with discord.js were interested in using any parts of my commands, or command handler. A lot of this code is very poorly written, but it all works as it should. I hope someone somewhere can find a use for it! Happy developing! :)
