<h1>AppBot - Discordapp Bot for the Official AppValley Discord Server<h1>
<h6>AppBot is a DiscordApp bot built using Node.js and the Discordapp API. This bot originially started out in python as a small botfor simple response commands (See https://github.com/RevokedCookie/appbot-py ), and soon became a bot that would run the entire official AppValley Discord server. It has since been archived, and is no longer used as my newest public Discord bot, Retr0n, has started to run the logging, moderation, and everything on that guild. IÂ´ve  set this repository to public, incase any developers starting with discord.js were interested in using any parts of my commands, or command handler. A lot of this code is very poorly written, but it all works as it should. I've recently made this project public, as the AppBot project has discontinued due to my new public Discord bot, Retr0n, now running the server's logging, moderation, and such. I ended up making the new edition of AppBot 2.3 public, but later found this code and decided to make it public as well. I hope someone somewhere can find a use for it! Happy developing! :)</h6>

  <h5>Below i've added some command samples for a visual of the most used commands! NOTE: These screenshots may show ID mentions, or images loading. This is becouse these messages are EXTREAMLY old, as well as this version of the bot. Due to this, some user images, names, roles, etc have been deleted, and no longer show as they did back then.</h5>
