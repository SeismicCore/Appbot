<h1>AppBot - Discordapp Bot for the Official AppValley Discord Server: Original python edition</h1>
<h6>AppBot is a discord.py (old async version) bot that was developed for managing the official AppValley Discord server. It's main purpose was to stop advertising, block some words, an dmost importiantly: Have simple response commands to help out users. It also had some moderation and logging features for the server. The bot was originally developer in Python using discord.py's aysnc version. This version is VERY old now, and i dont reccomend using this code as source for any new project. The bot served in python for about three months in this very poorly written one-file format, untill it was updated into node.js. You can see that version here: https://github.com/RevokedCookie/appbot . This version of the bot included a leveling system, witch was a very cool system that i developed using json, and was probally the highlight of this project. This code is EXTREAMLY poorly written, as it was one of my first programming projects EVER!! Most of the bot is just simple response commands to give users a quick and easy way to get information, but things like the leveing system and chat filters, as well as moderation was actually pretty usefull. Hopefully someone canfind this project interesting, or maybe even find a use for it someday. Happy developing! :)</h6>

 <h5>NOTE: These screenshots may show ID mentions, or images loading. This is becouse these messages are EXTREAMLY old, as well as this version of the bot. Due to this, some user images, names, roles, etc have been deleted, and no longer show as they did back then.</h5>
